# Next Token Predictor

ðŸš€ **Next Token Predictor**

A simple, interactive Python tool for predicting the next token in a text sequence using OpenAI's GPT model. This project is designed for educational purposes, NLP experimentation, and as a potential foundation for more advanced AI projects.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Predicts the next token in a user-provided text sequence
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model to predict the next token in your sequence
- Clean, user-friendly interface (see screenshot above)
- Easy to extend and customize for your own experiments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/m2web/next-token-predictor.git
   cd next-token-predictor
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the predictor:

```sh
python next_token_predictor.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input your text and see the predicted next token.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input your text and see the predicted next token. The app will display the top predicted next tokens and their probabilities, as provided by the OpenAI model.
